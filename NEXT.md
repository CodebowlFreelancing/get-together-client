# Next steps and stuff to remember

1. Create event page

   - Combine labels into inputs with hoc, required anyways everytime
     - How to display which inputs are required, which are not?
     - What about validation? Would be nice to have that before trying to send the form
   - Times are inputed using inputs "date" and "time", implement an UI layout for asking them
     - Layout should have option to add another range
     - Leave room for a "calendar" feature that can be brough in from the side, displaying selected dates
     - Find out a way to localize inputs (based on what?)
   - Add RSVP bool and possibility to select which are are in use, possibly in same component
     - Consider how this could be integrated into giving times, adding multiple times makes RSVP required

2. Event / participation page
